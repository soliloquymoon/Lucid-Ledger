<b>Lucid Ledger</b> is a deck-based business simulation game in a futuristic fantasy world. As the dream accountant, you buy dreams from the market, edit them with cards to increase their value, and sell them in the market.

Each card modifies the attributes of the dream but reduces its stability. Your task is to strategically balance between higher profit and risk of collapse.

## Features

* **Deck-based Editing System**: Build your own strategy for drawing and playing cards to maximize dream value.
* **Stability Mechanic**: Manage stability carefully or lose everything.
* **Tag Unlocks & Scaling**: Reach certain stat thresholds to unlock tags that shape market demand.
* **Daily Trends**: Adapt your strategy to shifting daily trends in the dream market.
